# E Commerce Counter
It is a E-Commerce component made with javascript. The uses case for this counter can be seen while increasing/decreasing the no.of orders for a product.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Heavylifting for this project is done through Javascript while the buttons are there for the user to interact with. 

## Optimizations
Instead of just creating the component without styling, I applied a background color and hover effects, color for the buttons to make it appealing to the eye. 

## Lessons Learned:
Even a simple counter app like this also requires you to think through the process and write some pseudo code to understand things better and write efficent code.
